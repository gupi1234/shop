        Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods
        or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent
        to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types
        has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as

        shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure
        activity. Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail
        industry as consumers can now search for product
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a> and
        place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver
        their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever
        they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for
        consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to
        have it delivered

        quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume
        energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time
        and the cost of traveling.
